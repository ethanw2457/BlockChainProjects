# Blockchain Ethereum Project with Remix - Beginner Model

This project is part of a course designed to introduce students to Ethereum blockchain development using Remix, a powerful browser-based IDE. This beginner-friendly repository provides an introduction to smart contract development and deployment on Ethereum.

## Project Overview

In this course, we will:
- Learn the basics of blockchain technology and Ethereum.
- Develop and deploy simple smart contracts using the Solidity programming language.
- Use the Remix IDE to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts.
- Interact with deployed contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask.

### What You Will Learn:
1. Basics of Blockchain and Ethereum.
2. Introduction to Solidity.
3. Using Remix to develop and test smart contracts.
4. Deploying contracts on the Ethereum test network.
5. Interacting with smart contracts using Remix and MetaMask.

## Requirements

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Web3 Wallet (MetaMask)**: Install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Remix IDE**: You can access the Remix IDE at [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org).
3. **Ethereum Test Network**: You will need some test Ether to deploy contracts on a test network like Rinkeby or Goerli. Get free test Ether from a faucet like [Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).
